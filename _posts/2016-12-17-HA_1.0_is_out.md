After almost three years we have finally reached version 1.0. Although it is not yet polished and there are many 
frameworks/features not supported, we think that we are ready to save developer's time for standard project setup 
and daily work. Give it a try!

Special thanks to:

1. Vladimir Dvorak - who took over project development (while original author Jiri Bubnik is busy on a commercial project)
1. Ivan Dubrov - author of DCEVM project
1. alpapad - META-INF + Maven Versioning support
1. Jan Tecl - new website graphics
  
What is on our roadmap now?

1. Propagation of Hotswap Agent (please share or write a blog), bugfixing 
1. Spring features, reload .xml configuration files
1. OpenWebBeans (OWB)
1. support for [Payara](http://www.payara.fish/)
1. support for [HK2](https://hk2.java.net)
1. Set a roadmap :-) (if you want a framework or feature on our roadmap, plase creata a GitHub issue)
